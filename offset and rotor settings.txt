#Offset operation
#move each letter of substitution alphabet forwards the number of places A is from the offset letter (e.g. if B is the offset letter, A is 25 places forwards from B. So E would become D)
#cipher letter is directly below the plaintext letter moved forward by the number of places the offset letter is from A (e.g. if B is the offset letter, B is 1 place forwards from A. If the plaintext letter entered is C, it is treated as a D and encoded as E)
#NB rotor 3 is always advanced before a letter is encrypted (e.g. if the rotor start position is AAA, the actual configuration is AAB when the first letter is entered)

#Ringstellung operation
#find the dot position of the offset letter; its position in the substitution alphabet counting from 0-25 (e.g. dot pos of A = 20)
#get the number of places the ring setting is from the offset and add to the dot position (e.g. if A is the offset, C is two places away from A so the new dot position is 22)
#move each letter of substitution alphabet forwards the number of places ring setting letter is away from offset letter (e.g. C is two places away from A. So E would become G)
#shift the entire new cipher alphabet forwards until the ring setting letter is in the dot position calculated before
